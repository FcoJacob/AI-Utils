### What is a Design token ?

Design token is an extremely versatile way to share design properties.
They are the visual elements of the layout system. We use them instead of 'hardcoded' values ​​to maintain a consistent and scalable visual system.
It is centralized data, almost like a database of design values.

Inside Figma application we have [PROD-DESIGN-TOKENS](https://www.figma.com/file/t3CZe6msXR1uIhiEv67Iql/PROD-DESIGN-TOKENS?node-id=0%3A1) view connected
with [Figma's api](https://aidacanarias.visualstudio.com/CrossCutting%20and%20Innovation/_git/sima-suite-figma) in order to download tokens.
To apply any change inside tokens we must do it in figma application. Next from simasuite-components repository we need to execute _npm run tokens_ to update tokens files and push them to the repository.
